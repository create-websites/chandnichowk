                <p>
                    At present, the street of Khari Baoli has a congested and busy market with shops 
                    on both sides selling spices, nuts and herbs. The visitor will have a unique 
                    experience here viewing the whole process of market of loading, carrying or 
                    unloading of huge sacks of items from manual trolleys, shopkeepers busy in 
                    dealing with the customers, customers selecting large quantities of items and 
                    weary laborers resting and chatting aloud. The overall appearance seems to be 
                    very chaotic but in reality it is very well managed if kept in consideration the 
                    fact that such a large amount of trading of small items are carried out daily.
