    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Subtle Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed around a narrative journey with three core thematic sections: 'The Imperial Vision' (History), 'The Living Fabric' (Culture & Commerce), and 'Erasure & Reinvention' (Modern Challenges). This structure allows users to explore non-linearly, either chronologically, thematically by interest (e.g., markets, food), or by focusing on contemporary issues. Navigation is handled by a sticky top bar. Interactions include clickable timeline events, an interactive map/grid for markets, filterable galleries for landmarks, and toggle-based sections for the redevelopment analysis. This is more intuitive than the report's linear format, encouraging exploration and comparison. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Timeline: Goal: Show historical progression. Method: Interactive horizontal HTML/CSS timeline. Interaction: Click on eras to reveal detailed text blocks. Justification: More engaging than a static list.
        - Sacred Landmarks: Goal: Compare construction periods. Method: Chart.js Bar Chart. Interaction: Hover tooltips for dates/details. Justification: Visually represents the layering of faiths over time.
        - Specialized Bazaars: Goal: Organize and detail the markets. Method: Interactive HTML grid of cards. Interaction: Clicking a card reveals a modal with detailed information. Justification: Cleaner and more interactive than a long table.
        - Havelis: Goal: Compare the different fates. Method: A three-column layout with clickable cards. Interaction: Click to expand and read the story of each haveli. Justification: Facilitates direct comparison of preservation outcomes.
        - Redevelopment Issues: Goal: Explain complex failures. Method: Toggled content sections. Interaction: Click on an issue (e.g., "Governance Failure") to expand the explanation. Justification: Breaks down complex information into digestible, user-controlled chunks.

                    <p class="mb-4">Chandni Chowk is a profound and irreplaceable urban entity, a palimpsest bearing the marks of centuries of imperial design, commercial dynamism, and social transformation. Its contemporary existence is defined by a fundamental tension: the conflict between its identity as a priceless heritage zone and its function as a vital economic engine for hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The recent redevelopment project, despite its laudable intentions, has largely failed to resolve this tension. By prioritizing a sanitized aesthetic over the area's living, organic character, the project has highlighted a critical need for a more holistic and sustainable approach to its future.</p>

                        <li><strong>Establish a Unified Governance Authority:</strong> Create a single, empowered management body for the Shahjahanabad heritage zone to overcome jurisdictional conflicts and ensure accountability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adopt an Integrative Conservation Philosophy:</strong> Move beyond superficial beautification to respect the area's complex layers, including its 'living heritage' of informal economies. Authentically reference historical features and integrate, rather than displace, local workers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implement Community-Centric Planning:</strong> Develop future plans through a consultative process involving all stakeholders—traders, residents, and informal workers—to ensure solutions are grounded in reality and have local buy-in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Revive Sustainable Public Transport:</strong> Re-examine the potential for a modern, non-polluting tram system to address congestion and provide efficient last-mile connectivity, nodding to the area's own history of public transit.</li>
